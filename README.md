# :mag:Exploratory Data Analysis of diamonds
The main objective of this project is to present a report based on a dataset about main features of diamonds and his price. In this first approach, the data will be analyzed and how some variables are related to others.

## Requirements :page_facing_up:
### Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ChristianJavierMelo/ih_datamadpt0420_project_m2.git
```
Exploratory analysis is done in a jupyter notebook file named **data_analysis_report.ipynb** based on the dataset located into data folder and named **diamonds_train.csv**.
### Technology stack
it is necessary to have the following libraries installed to make use of the exploratory analysis
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### External source

see the next website to have a knowledge about [the feature of diamonds](https://www.bluenile.com/education/diamonds). In summarize:

1. **Carat**: The term carat actually refers to the diamond's total weight and not its size.
2. **Cut**: The most important of the 4Cs is cut because it has the greatest influence on a diamond's sparkle.
3. **Color**: The second most important of the 4Cs is color, which refers to a diamond's lack of color. The less color, the higher the grade.
4. **Clarity**: Often the least important of the 4Cs because the tiny imperfections are often microscopic.
5. **Depth**: The height of a gemstone measured from the culet to the table
6. **Table**: The largest facet of a gemstone

## Analysis :mag:
The analysis that has been carried out is based on a statistical study on the data belonging to the diamonds sample dataset from kaggle.
The analysis has been structured in two parts:
* Basic analysis: It is the first approach based on a study to know the data we have 
* Exploratory analysis: It is the second approach and it is focused on the price variable compared with the other features to have a predictive model in the future. In this second approach, the values are represented graphically to better understand the data.
### Basic analysis
I have made a first approach in the analysis, being a basic analysis to know the type of data we have in the whole dataset. To carry out this test, I have made a statistical analysis to find out the most common values when it comes to showing the characteristics of the dataset, classifying the categorical and numerical variables. I have also carried out a study of the maximum and minimum values for each variable and thus better understand the extreme values of the dataset.
### Exploratory analysis
In this second approach, I have focused the analysis surround the price variable compared with the other variables to know if exist any correlations between them. For it, I have built a correlation matrix plot to know the correlation between variables. after that I compared the numerical variables and the categorical variables to know one by one the established relationship to know the best relations with price variable.
With those data I will predict the price of the diamonds according tho his main features.
### Conclusion
It is deduced in these approximations that the price has a strong correlation with the carat variable and relevant information is extracted with the combination of the attributes classified as categorical for diamonds.

## Dashboard :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Dashboards are powerful tools for communicating important information at-a-glance. The goal of this challenge is to build a data dashboard using our diamonds dataset that will help myself to perform better during Module 3 project.

In the following link you will find a single interactive interface built around a specific objetive understanding a group of relationship between diamonds attributes (features) and its price.
